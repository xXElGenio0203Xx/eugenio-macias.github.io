# #Projects

**Research: Fourier Analysis and Laplace’s Equation**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Authored a 50-page research paper in Real Analysis and Linear Algebra: complex-real function theory, convergence criteria  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Explored the importance of Fourier Series to Laplace’s 2-D Equation solution space with 4 Boundary Dirichlet conditions

**Time-Series Forecasting (Python, ongoing)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Implemented a time series predictor algorithm in Python utilizing Bollinger-bands and Monte-Carlo Simulations  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Utilized changepoint detection, multiple linear regressions, ARIMA models, and Matplotlib-Seaborn for visualizations  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Employed the Etrade API for real-time data and parsed index pricing and variance statistics using XML Etree Libraries  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Plan to integrate the Backtrader library for trading simulation. Calculated KPIs using the Scikit library

**Decision-Tree Algorithm (Java) (School-Related)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Implemented an ML decision-tree algorithm in Java that achieved up to 96% accuracy in large CSV datasets  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Utilized tree structures and classification algorithms enabling decision-making based on input features and a CSV parser

**Game-AI (ReasonML) (School-Related)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Implemented a Connect-4 game calculator and module for MxN-board dimensions using matrix representations  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Assigned numerical values to a Mini-Max Algorithm allowing the AI to outperform 100% of human moves

**Graph-Optimizer Algorithm (Python) (School-Related)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Created a graph algorithm that optimizes edge-paths based on cost, distance, time-efficiency, and customizable parameters  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Employed graph structure algorithms like Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS. Tested with graphs with 500+ vertices and edges

**ReasonML-Racket Interpreter (School-Related)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Developed an interpreter in ReasonML capable of interpreting and processing all inputs from Racket  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Implemented advanced pattern matching techniques to efficiently analyze and interpret Racket code entered into the ReasonML environment. It accurately replicates the behavior of DrRacket, providing precise Racket code output while executing within the ReasonML environment  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Successfully processed complex DrRacket programs, including those exceeding 500+ lines of code, demonstrating the scalability of the interpreter

**Mutex-Safe Database (C) (School-Related)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Implemented a multithreaded server database that listens for client connections, tested to work with 100+ server clients  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The server utilizes dynamic thread management, and a flexible mutex mechanism to allow concurrency between clients

**Unix Shell (C) (School-Related)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Implemented a custom Unix shell using C, working with system calls and process management  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Developed features such as command parsing, executing external commands, handling signals, and file redirections
