# Projects

**Research: Fourier Analysis and Laplace’s Equation**  
- Authored a 50-page research paper in Real Analysis and Linear Algebra: complex-real function theory, convergence criteria
- Explored the importance of Fourier Series to Laplace’s 2-D Equation solution space with 4 Boundary Dirichlet conditions

**Time-Series Forecasting (Python, ongoing)**  
- Implemented a time series predictor algorithm in Python utilizing Bollinger-bands and Monte-Carlo Simulations
- Utilized changepoint detection, multiple linear regressions, ARIMA models, and Matplotlib-Seaborn for visualizations
- Employed the Etrade API for real-time data and parsed index pricing and variance statistics using XML Etree Libraries
- Plan to integrate the Backtrader library for trading simulation. Calculated KPIs using the Scikit library

**Decision-Tree Algorithm (Java)**  
- Implemented an ML decision-tree algorithm in Java that achieved up to 96% accuracy in large CSV datasets
- Utilized tree structures and classification algorithms enabling decision-making based on input features and a CSV parser

**Game-AI (ReasonML)**  
- Implemented a Connect-4 game calculator and module for MxN-board dimensions using matrix representations
- Assigned numerical values to a Mini-Max Algorithm allowing the AI to outperform 100% of human moves

**Graph-Optimizer Algorithm (Python)**  
- Created a graph algorithm that optimizes edge-paths based on cost, distance, time-efficiency, and customizable parameters
- Employed graph structure algorithms like Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS. Tested with graphs with 500+ vertices and edges
