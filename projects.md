&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Implemented an ML decision-tree algorithm in Java that achieved up to 96% accuracy in large CSV datasets  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Utilized tree structures and classification algorithms enabling decision-making based on input features and a CSV parser

**Game-AI (ReasonML) (School-Related)** <i class="fas fa-gamepad" style="color: #e74c3c;"></i>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Implemented a Connect-4 game calculator and module for MxN-board dimensions using matrix representations  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Assigned numerical values to a Mini-Max Algorithm allowing the AI to outperform 100% of human moves

**Graph-Optimizer Algorithm (Python) (School-Related)** <i class="fab fa-python" style="color: #3776AB;"></i>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Created a graph algorithm that optimizes edge-paths based on cost, distance, time-efficiency, and customizable parameters  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Employed graph structure algorithms like Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS. Tested with graphs with 500+ vertices and edges

**ReasonML-Racket Interpreter (ReasonML, Racket)(School-Related)** <i class="fas fa-code" style="color: #2ecc71;"></i>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Developed an interpreter in ReasonML capable of interpreting and processing all inputs from Racket  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Implemented advanced pattern matching techniques to efficiently analyze and interpret Racket code entered into the ReasonML environment. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- It replicates the behavior of DrRacket, providing precise Racket code output while executing within the ReasonML environment  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Successfully processed complex DrRacket programs, including those exceeding 500+ lines of code, demonstrating the scalability of the interpreter
