# Aspiring Mathematician & Computer Scientist
![Profile Picture](/assets/images/picture.png)
Hi, I’m Eugenio Macias! I’m an international student at Brown University, majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. My adventure started in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where I completed the International Baccalaureate at one of the United World Colleges. It was there that I discovered my love for traveling and experiencing new cultures. Since then, I’ve explored over 25 countries, making friends and trying food from all corners of the globe.

Academically, I’m passionate about bringing complex concepts to life, particularly in the fields of differential equations, probability theory, and statistical inference. These subjects aren’t just fascinating—they’re tools to solve real-world problems.

In my free time you’ll likely find me deep in a game of chess or strumming my classical guitar. These hobbies keep me balanced and inspired.
