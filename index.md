![Profile Picture](/assets/images/gportfolio_profile_picture.png){: .profile-pic }

<p class="bounce-in">Hi, I'm Eugenio Macias! I'm an international student at Brown University, majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. My adventure started in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where I completed the International Baccalaureate at one of the United World Colleges. It was there that I discovered my love for traveling and experiencing new cultures. Since then, I've explored over 20 countries, making friends from all corners of the globe.</p>

<p class="bounce-in">Academically, I'm passionate about bringing complex concepts to life, particularly in the fields of differential equations, probability theory, and statistical inference. These subjects aren't just fascinatingâ€”they're tools to solve real-world problems.</p>

<p class="bounce-in">You'll likely find me deep in a game of chess or strumming my classical guitar. These hobbies keep me balanced and inspired.</p>

<p class="bounce-in">I'm excited to keep learning, traveling, and connecting with  people along the way!</p>
