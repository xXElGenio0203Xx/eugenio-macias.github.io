    <h1>Aspiring Mathematician & Computer Scientist ðŸŒŽ </h1>

<p class="animated-text">Hi, I'm Eugenio Macias! I'm an international student from Mexico at Brown University, majoring in (BS) Applied Mathematics-Computer Science, and a concurrent (MS) Master's in Applied Mathematics. Next summer (2025) I will be interning at Citi in NYC as a Markests Quantitative Analyst.  My adventure started in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where I completed the International Baccalaureate at one of the United World Colleges. It was there that I discovered my love for traveling and experiencing new cultures. Since then, I've explored over 25 countries, making friends from all corners of the globe.</p>
<br>

<p class="animated-text">Academically, I'm passionate about bringing complex concepts to life, particularly in the fields of probability theory, mathematical statistics. These subjects aren't just fascinatingâ€”they're tools to solve real-world problems. I am planning to pursue a career for opportunities in quantitative finance as a Quant-Researcher, or as a Quant-Trader.</p>
<br>

<p class="animated-text">You'll likely find me deep in a game of chess or playing my classical guitar. These hobbies keep me balanced and inspired.</p>
<br>

<p class="animated-text">I'm excited to keep learning, traveling, trying new food, and making friends along the way!</p>
