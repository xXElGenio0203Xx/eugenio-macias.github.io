<p class="animated-text">Hi, I'm Eugenio Macias! I'm an international student at Brown University, majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. My adventure started in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where I completed the International Baccalaureate at one of the United World Colleges. It was there that I discovered my love for traveling and experiencing new cultures. Since then, I've explored over 20 countries, making friends from all corners of the globe.</p>
<br>

<p class="animated-text">Academically, I'm passionate about bringing complex concepts to life, particularly in the fields of differential equations, probability theory, and statistical inference. These subjects aren't just fascinatingâ€”they're tools to solve real-world problems.</p>
<br>

<p class="animated-text">You'll likely find me deep in a game of chess or playing my classical guitar. These hobbies keep me balanced and inspired.</p>
<br>

<p class="animated-text">I'm excited to keep learning, traveling, trying new food, and making friends along the way!</p>
